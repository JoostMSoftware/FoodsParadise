## Summary

Foods Paradise is a simple food mod that explores new ways of making foods, sweets and such. 
It may be "just another food mod", but I try to make it unique in what you do.

This mod is made for Fabric 1.19.4 and could be for forge later.

## FAQ

Q: Will there be a 1.19.2 version?<br>
A: Yes, eventually. 1.19.4 is basically just here to get feedback on the mod and see if it has potential.

Q: Forge? <br>
A: Later yes
